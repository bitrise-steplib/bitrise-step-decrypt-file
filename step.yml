title: Decrypt file
summary: This step decrypts a file encrypted with `gpg`, using the default AES128 symmetric cypher.
description: |

    You can use this step to decrypt a file in your repository or stored on bitrise.io or other provider (with the File Downloader step).

    How to create an encrypted file:

    1. Create a secure passphrase of at least 22 alphanumeric characters: `pwgen -s 22 1`
    2. Encrypt file: `gpg -c my_secret.txt`
    3. Upload file (`my_secret.txt.gpg`) to bitrise.io or to any other provider.
