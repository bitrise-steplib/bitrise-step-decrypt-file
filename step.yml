title: Decrypt file
summary: This Step decrypts a file encrypted with `gpg`, using the default AES128 symmetric cypher.
description: |
  The Step decrypts a file encrypted with `gpg`. This can be helpful if you would like to store an encrypted file in your repository, like a `google-services.json` file used to authenticate your project. Using this Step, you can decrypt that file and use it in your Workflow.

  To create an encrypted file with `gpg`:
  1. Create a secure passphrase of at least 32 alphanumeric characters: `pwgen -s 32 1`
  2. Encrypt the file; in this example, the file is called `my_secret.txt`: `gpg -c my_secret.txt`

  ### Configuring the Step

  1. Add the generated passphrase as a **Secret to the Passphrase for file decryption** input.
  1. Specify the location of the encrypted file in the **Encrypted file path** input.
  1. Specify the location where you would like to place the decrypted file in the **Output (decrypted) file path** input.
